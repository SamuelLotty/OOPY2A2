This was my attempt at practising Encapsulation.

The folder src contains the code of the Java application.  
o MyMain.java => This class tests the functionality of Lab03. This class is 
provided completed, so you must not modify it.  
o Dog.java => Our class modelling the concept of a dog. You must complete this 
class. However, for the get and set methods, and the extra methods, you can 
reuse them from Lab02.   
o Toy.java => A class modelling a Dog toy. This class is provided completed, so 
you must not modify it. - - 
The folder javadoc contains the documentation of the Java application.  
o MyMain.html => This file contains the description of the class MyMain.java. 
o Dog.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get 
methods, set methods and extra functionality of the class Dog.java. Use this file 
to guide you in completing the code of the file Dog.java.  
o Toy.html => This file contains the description of the fields, constructor, get and 
set methods of the class Toy.java.   
The folder results contains the expected results of the Java application.  
o result_option_1.txt => This file contains the output obtained from running the 
lecturerâ€™s solution when using <option = 1> in the main method of 
MyMain.java. That is, when the Java application is used to test the functionality 
of the first constructor of the class Dog.  
o result_option_2.txt => Running the application with <option = 2>  for testing 
the second constructor of the class Dog. 
o result_option_3.txt => Running the application with <option = 3>  for testing 
the copy constructor in shallow mode of the class Dog. 
o result_option_4.txt => Running the application with <option = 4>  for testing 
the copy constructor in deep mode of the class Dog. 
Actions: 
1. Complete the class Dog.java.  
The fields, constructor, get methods, set methods and extra functionality must follow 
the description given by the Javadoc files Dog.html.
